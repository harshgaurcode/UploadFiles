# UploadFiles


File Upload API

This API allows users to upload files to a server. The uploaded files are saved to a directory on the server with a unique file name.

Usage:

To use this API, you can send a POST request to the /UploadFile endpoint with the file you want to upload attached to the request. The API will save the file to the server and return a success message.

Example request:

POST /UploadFile
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

[file]
Example response:

{
    "message": "File uploaded successfully"
}
Error handling:

If the file upload fails, the API will return an error message. Some possible error messages include:

File too large
Invalid file type
File upload failed
Additional considerations:

You may want to add additional validation to the API, such as checking the file size and file type.
You may also want to implement error handling to handle cases where the file upload fails.
You may want to consider using a more robust file upload library, such as Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Mvc.FileFilters.
